# `libtest` - A Unit Tests Library (Legacy)

Subject: None. This was not a school project.

This is my legacy test framework. It's a spin off of the functions I used to
test the exercises during the [piscine](../piscine). I also used it to test some
of my [libft functions](../libft/test/src/tests.c).

/!\ This library has been superseded by a newer test framework [libunit](../libunit).

You can learn more about the api and implementation in
[libtest.h](include/libtest.h) and [libtest.c](src/libtest.c).
