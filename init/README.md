# init - An Introduction to System and Network Administration

Subject: [init.en.pdf](init.en.pdf)

This (simple) project was an introduction to Sysadmin work.

A lot of the questions were ambiguous because they were not properly formulated
(eg. [network/05](network/05)). In such cases I tried to answer to all the
possible interpretations.

For the custom script question, I gave my rather extensive [installation
script](scripts/03).
