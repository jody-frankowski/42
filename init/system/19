# List all services which are started at boot time and name this kind of services
systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled

# OR
# chkconfig --list

# They don't have a particular name. "daemon" wouldn't be perfectly appropriate
# because they are services that run in background, but are not necessarily
# started at boot. So I would just call them "services that are started at boot".
